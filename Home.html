                <p class="h">About Me</p>
                <p class="p">I am Kaleab Mengesha, student at DirectEd it's my first time learning under an organization but I have been developing my skill on programming by myself like C, C++, a little bit of Java, HTML, CSS, Assembly, Python. <br>
                    I have been exercising those courses before I joined DirectEd. <br>
                    As a hobby I really love source code programming or Reverse Engineering (Disassembling) PE files which are executables, and understanding the working principles of programs from the perspective of the CPU itself.</p><hr>
